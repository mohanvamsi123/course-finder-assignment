Lot more enhancements can be made

1. IMAGES: Images can be optimised into sprites, so we can download all images as single sprite in a single network call, which will reduce the network requests improves performance. 
2. Rendering: SSR can be implemented for some parts of the screen like toolbar, which will helps us to make webpage load faster, and other parts can be progressively rendered.
3. FrameWork: Application can be developed using frameworks like Vue.js or React(Library) which will give developer more felxibiltiy in terms of development and also provides better performance since we can utilise the power of those frameworks and libraries
